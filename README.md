# Game-Engine
A game engine I created myself.

I did two tutorials, got to different stages, and ended up melding the bits that I liked together into this. This is all created by me, but most of the graphics system is from [a tutorial by the Thin Matrix](https://youtu.be/VS8wlS9hF8E "Youtube").

I have stopped working on this engine, and decided to create a [C++ Engine](https://github.com/Bailey-Moir/Cpp-Engine) instead.
