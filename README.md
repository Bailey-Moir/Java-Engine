# Game-Engine
A game engine I created myself.

I did two tutorials, got to different stages, and ended up melding the bits that I liked together into this. Most of this is created by me, but the graphics/rendering system is from a tutorial, I would reference it but I don't know what one.

I ended up abandoning this project before I got to far because Java sucks. I swapped to C++, same library though (GLFW).
